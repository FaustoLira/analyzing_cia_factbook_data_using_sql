# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

## Introduction

This project uses SQL, through an iteration of SQL with Jupyter Notebook, to explore 
and analyze data from the CIA World Factbook, a comprehensive resource that provides 
demographic and statistical information about every country on Earth.

Insights were gained into global population trends, land and water distribution, and 
various demographic rates. Essentially, this project aims to answer the following questions.

Here we will deal with the following questions: 

Q1. Which country has the largest and smallest population? How is population growth in these countries?  
Q2. Which country has more waters than land?  
Q3. Which are the top 3 contries that have a higher death rate than birth rate?

The data was downloaded from Dataquest.io and can be found
