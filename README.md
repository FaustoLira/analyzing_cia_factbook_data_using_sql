# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information.

Here we will deal with the following questions: 

Q1. Which country has the largest and smallest population? How is population growth in these countries?  
Q2. Which country has more waters than land?  
Q3. Which are the top 3 contries that have a higher death rate than birth rate?
